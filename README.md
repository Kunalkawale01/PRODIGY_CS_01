# PRODIGY_CS_01

The Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption project is a simple Python-based application that implements a classical cryptography technique. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages by shifting
alphabetic characters using a user-defined key. The program supports both uppercase and lowercase letters while keeping spaces and special characters unchanged, making it an easy and effective way to understand
basic encryption concepts.
